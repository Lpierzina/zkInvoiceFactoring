## üí° Why Zero-Knowledge? (Business Pitch)

> **Lenders need trust. Borrowers need privacy.**
>
> ZK Invoice Factoring lets businesses **prove they meet reliability criteria** (e.g., ‚Äú95% of invoices paid on time‚Äù) to any loan provider, without sharing:
> - Exact client list
> - Revenue or deal size
> - Any other confidential details
>
> **It‚Äôs win-win:**  
> Lenders get trusted, tamper-proof data.  
> Borrowers keep full privacy and control.

üìù Invoice Reliability Scorecard: Manual vs. Automated Modes
ZK Invoice Factoring supports both:

QuickBooks-connected (Automated) Mode:
All six lender checks are performed using live data from QuickBooks.

Manual Entry Mode:
Only the two most critical checks are run (Invoice Reliability and Debt-to-Income Ratio) for fast, privacy-friendly scoring.

How It Works
If you connect QuickBooks:
The backend runs all 6 criteria:

Invoice Reliability (paid % threshold)

Debt-to-Income Ratio

Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)

Accounts Receivable Aging

Annual Revenue

Customer Concentration

If you enter numbers manually:
Only Invoice Reliability and DTI Ratio are checked for a simple, rapid screen‚Äîno extra business details required.

This ensures:

Businesses can prove reliability instantly, even without sharing all financials

Lenders get a fast risk screen, with the option to require more detailed proof (via QuickBooks integration) if needed

‚öôÔ∏è Manual/Automated Mode Detection
The backend automatically detects manual mode when you submit only the core required fields, or you can send a "manual": true flag for clarity.

This lets you embed or integrate ZK Invoice Factoring in any context‚Äîfull API, SaaS dashboard, or widget.

Example API Payloads
Manual Mode:


{
  "total_invoices": 12,
  "paid_invoices": 11,
  "threshold_percent": 90,
  "total_debt": 3000,
  "total_income": 10000,
  "dti_threshold_bp": 4000,
  "manual": true
}
QuickBooks (Full) Mode:

{
  "total_invoices": 85,
  "paid_invoices": 77,
  "threshold_percent": 90,
  "total_debt": 9000,
  "total_income": 31000,
  "dti_threshold_bp": 4000,
  "dso": 39,
  "dso_threshold": 45,
  "ar_over60": 1100,
  "ar_total": 7400,
  "ar_pct_threshold_bp": 1000,
  "revenue12mo": 142000,
  "revenue_threshold": 120000,
  "largest_cust_sales": 35000,
  "total_sales": 84000,
  "concentration_threshold_bp": 5000
}
üü¢ ‚ÄúPasses All Lender Criteria‚Äù Logic
Manual: Both reliability and DTI must pass (‚úÖ).

QuickBooks: All six criteria must pass (‚úÖ).

UI and API responses will always show only the relevant checks for the current mode.
