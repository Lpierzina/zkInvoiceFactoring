## 💡 Why Zero-Knowledge? (Business Pitch)

> **Lenders need trust. Borrowers need privacy.**
>
> ZK Invoice Factoring lets businesses **prove they meet reliability criteria** (e.g., “95% of invoices paid on time”) to any loan provider, without sharing:
> - Exact client list
> - Revenue or deal size
> - Any other confidential details
>
> **It’s win-win:**  
> Lenders get trusted, tamper-proof data.  
> Borrowers keep full privacy and control.
